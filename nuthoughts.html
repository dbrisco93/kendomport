 <p>I spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts. Writing. Listening. And collecting old Beach cruisers. The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.</p> 

<p>I go months without a phone.</p>

<p>Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone, but the glimmers of God speak through my music and family.</p>

<p>While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what matters the most. The life in which my words will land next.</p>

<p>As I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years. The Struggles. The Success. And most importantly, the Brotherhood. May the Most High continue to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid creators. As I continue to pursue my life’s calling.
</p>
<p>There’s beauty in completion. And always faith in the unknown.</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I’ve prayed for you all.</p>

<p>See you soon enough.</p>
